1. Select Statement Problems

1. 

SELECT eventrequest.eventno, eventplanline.planno, COUNT(*) AS countevent
FROM eventplanline, eventrequest, eventplan
WHERE eventrequest.eventno = eventplan.eventno AND eventplan.planno = eventplanline.planno
AND eventplan.workdate BETWEEN '2013-12-01' AND '2013-12-31'
GROUP BY eventplanline.planno, eventrequest.eventno HAVING COUNT(*)>1

2. 

SELECT planno, eventrequest.eventno, workdate, activity, facname 
FROM eventplan, eventrequest, facility
WHERE facility.facno = eventrequest.facno AND eventrequest.eventno = eventplan.eventno
AND workdate BETWEEN '2013-12-01' AND '2013-12-31'
AND facname = 'Basketball arena'

3. 

SELECT eventno, dateheld, status, estcost
FROM eventrequest, facility, customer
WHERE eventrequest.facno = facility.facno AND customer.custno = eventrequest.custno
AND facname = 'Basketball arena'
AND dateheld BETWEEN '2013-10-01' AND '2013-12-31'
AND contact = 'Mary Manager'

4.

SELECT eventplanline.planno, lineno, resname, numberfld, locname, timestart, timeend
FROM eventplanline, resourcetbl, location, facility, eventplan
WHERE location.locno = eventplanline.locno AND eventplanline.resno = resourcetbl.resno
AND facility.facno = location.facno AND eventplan.planno = eventplanline.planno
AND facname = 'Basketball arena'
AND activity = 'Operation'
AND workdate BETWEEN '2013-10-01' AND '2013-12-31'


2. Database Modification Problems

1. 

INSERT INTO facility (facno, facname) VALUES ('F104', 'Swimming Pool')

2.

INSERT INTO location (locno, facno, locname) VALUES ('L107', 'F104', 'Door')

3. 

INSERT INTO location (locno, facno, locname) VALUES ('L108', 'F104', 'Locker room')

4.

UPDATE location SET locname='Gate' WHERE locname='Door' AND facno='F104'

5.

DELETE FROM location WHERE locname='Locker room' AND facno='F104'
